Here we have 3 notebooks, each answering a different question from the case study. 
Q1 - Is there a connection between quantity of sales and discounts?
Q2 - Is there a connection between number of orders and territories?
Q3 - Freeform - Is there a connection between employees and the total amount of their sales? A connection between employees and the number of items in each of their sales?

There is also a functions.py file from which one can import the various functions all in one neat spot.

Our conclusions
Q1 - We reject the Null hypothesis and state there is not no relation between quantity ordered and discount

Q2 - We use anova test here to test the quantities in different territories.
The p-value is 0.55 which is greater than 0.05. We fail to reject the null hypothises.
Therefore there is no difference in number of orders and territory.

Q3 - There was indeed a connection between employees and total order price, as well as a connection between employees and total order quantity. Some employees outperforming others. Anne and Robert, in particular, excelled. See the notebooks for details.
